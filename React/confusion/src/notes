Redux middleware provides the capability to intercept actions before they are dispatched to the redux store

It forms a pipeline that wraps around teh dsipatch

 middleware pipleline is done by calling applyMiddleWare function from redux

 Thunk
 it is a programming subroutine that is used to inject and additional calculation in another subroutine
 allows you to write an action creator that returns a function instead of an action
   -> can be used to delay the dispatch of an action or dispatch when a certain condition is met
 The inner function defined inside a thunk gives you action to getState and dispatch methods

Web services
A designed way to support interoperability of systems connected over a network
It is called Service Oriented Architecture (SOAP)
Two common approaches to web services include:
SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) based services
    uses WSDL (Web Services Description Language)
    is XML based
REST (Representational State Transfer)
   Uses Web Standards
   Exchange of data using either XML or JSON
   Simpler compared to SOAP, WSDL etc

REST is a style of software architecture that is designed for distributed hypermedia systems like the World Wide Web
It was introduced as a doctoral dissertation by Roy Fielding
The architecture addresses a number of principles that specify how resources ae define and addressed
It has four main  design principles
  built upon HTTP protocol
  Desinged to be stateless
  Way of providing resources is to expose their urls
  Supports JSON and XML as data exchange format
Motivation for suggesting REST:
    Capture the xtics of the Web that made it successful
    like uri to address resources
    HTTP protocol
    Make request, receive response, display response

In the REST World you'll hear of Nouns (resources), Verbs (actions) and Representations (how resources are conveyed
back to the client)
REST uses URI to identify resources

A promise is a proxy for a value that will or never become available
Promise has three states
    Pending
    Fulfilled and
    Rejected state

Fetch API is a modern replacement of the XMPHttpRequest()
Other Fetch alternatives include: Axios and Superagent
